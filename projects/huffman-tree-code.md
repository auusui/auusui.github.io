  This project's purpose was to continue to use binary trees and learning how the system works as well as how to use it.  I was to create the body of the functions decode, encode, and decompress.  Learning outcomes for this project were to use Huffman trees to encode and decode files and write a program that decompresses files that were compressed using Huffman encoding.  This project helped me be more comfortable with Binary Trees/Huffman Trees, reading binary data using java, and reading/understanding/modifying existing java code using Eclipse.  

  Attached at the bottom of this paragraph is the link to our assignment outline.  It will show all the requirements we had to meet for our programming.  This was a moderate level in terms of difficulty because it was using methods we had done all semester, but I was also just learning what Huffman Trees were.  I developed better problem-solving skills with this project because I kept getting a null-pointer exception and it took a lot of collaboration to figure out what the problem was.  I did many debugs and step-by-step evaluating to see where the problem rooted.
