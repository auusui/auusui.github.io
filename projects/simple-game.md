## About the Game

I took a video game design class as one of my electives because I wanted to reach out to different fields that computer science offered.  In this class, our first assignment was to create a simple game with the objectives of collecting an item for a boost in score, obstacles that you need to avoid, movement with the keyboard keys, and play sounds when either collecting or running into an obstacle.  Because I am a CS student, we were required to do the movement in C# and then rest in Bolt or C#.  I wanted to use Bolt because it was a new skill that interested me.  


## C# Scripting
Example of my movement script in C#:

```ruby

```

A script I used to do a bounce effect on the walls, but it didn't seem to work the way I wanted.
``` ruby

```


## Bolt in Unity
These images below are the flow machines I used for the obstacles and coins.  Bolt is very easy to use and I learned how to use it fairly easy.  It is just like scripting in C#, but it actually makes it easier for you because it will only show you connecting options that work.   At first, Bolt was very confusing to me because I didn't know where to put the pointer arrows, or where to start.  After looking at many tutorials, you start to see where it would go in C# scripting and translate it into the flow machine.  The more I saw examples, the better I was able to look at C# and make it into a flow machine.  This was a very good learning experience and I got to see how adaptable I am to new platforms.
