The Covid pandemic has disrupted global human civilization. But how has it disrupted you? It can be therapeutic to spend a little bit of 
time reflecting on how your life has changed in the past few weeks and to think about how you might best move forward in the face of great 
uncertainty.

What additional family, community, or work obligations you are taking on?
How has Covid impacted your ability to learn, not just in ICS 314, but also in any of your other classes?
What new things have you learned about yourself, your family, your friends, and your community?
What changes do you think you need to make in order to move forward successfully?
