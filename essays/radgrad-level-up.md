In order to improve RadGrad2 as well as help code/design it, I need to know it like the back of my hand.  The intial RadGrad focused on motivating the student to level up using the ICE points system.  Currently, I am level 2, but I am 1 Innovation point away from becoming level 3.  I am stilling waiting for my club to verify my request, which will bring me up to 5 Innovation points.  Then I have 25 also waiting to be verified through the RadGrad Project.  I will have 54 Competency points once this semester's classes get verified into the system as well as my summer courses finish this session.  Lastly, I have 20 Experience points with this internship I am doing this summer. 

What did you find useful about RadGrad while trying to Level Up? Did you discover new features or information that you were not aware of before? 
What do you wish RadGrad had that it does not currently have? What changes would you advise in order to make RadGrad more useful to undergraduates at UH?
- had a hard time figuring out how to level up.  Make it more obvious that you have to favorite it then drag it into your degree plan then request verification in the side card.  Maybe put a sequence directions in the home page under a how to or in the ICE page.
