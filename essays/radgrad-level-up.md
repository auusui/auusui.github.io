# RadGrad Level Up

<img large src="/images/radGrad.png">

### ICE ICE BABY

In order to improve RadGrad2 as well as help code/design it, I need to know it like the back of my hand.  The intial RadGrad focused on motivating the student to level up using the ICE points system.  Currently, I am level 2, but I am 1 Innovation point away from becoming level 3.  I am stilling waiting for my club to verify my request, which will bring me up to 5 Innovation points.  Then I have 25 also waiting to be verified through the RadGrad Project.  I will have 54 Competency points once this semester's classes get verified into the system as well as my summer courses finish this session.  Lastly, I have 20 Experience points with this internship I am doing this summer an 5 points pending from my GreyHats club.  The way the system knows what points you have is from your degree plan.  You insert the classes, clubs, or jobs you completed/are going to complete into this degree plan page.  From there you can see what points are pending or verified. This is actually something I did not know you could do so I was confused on how I was supposed to gain points.  The way you can add components into your degree plan was to find it on the explore page and favorite it.  Your favorites will show up on the degree plan page on the side where you can the drag it.  For clubs and job opportunities, you click on it (the component inside your degree plan) and write a description of what you did then send a verification request.  When the owner accepts it, then it will update your ICE points.  On the ICE Points page, it tells you how many more points in what section you need in order to level up.  My favorite part about RadGrad is the Mentor Space page because it shows you a live feed of everyone's progress, allows you to ask any smart questions you have (see my essay on smart questions [here](https://auusui.github.io/essays/dont-be-a-luser-be-a-smart-user.html)), and it shows you other peoples questions/replies.  Some of the questions are very helpful for a student like me such as "What do you look for when hiring a new graduate?" or "What mistakes do CS students make during interviews?".  

### Improvements


What do you wish RadGrad had that it does not currently have? What changes would you advise in order to make RadGrad more useful to undergraduates at UH?
- had a hard time figuring out how to level up.  Make it more obvious that you have to favorite it then drag it into your degree plan then request verification in the side card.  Maybe put a sequence directions in the home page under a how to or in the ICE page.
