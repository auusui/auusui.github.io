# To Be Lazy or To Be Not

## Choices Choices Choices

Who knew computers had so many languages!  I see Javascript as an easier version of Java and also less strict.  I think it makes coding easier if you want to write down coding ideas or just practice certain algorithms.  Compared to C/C++, it is more alike, coding wise.  I am a newbie to Javascript and C/C++ this semester and I have learned so much already.  I took lessons on FreeCodeCamp and it showed me the basics of Javascript, but it was a bit overwhelming doing over 200 exercises. However, I donʻt think that I want to get comfortable with Javascript because it could make me lazy with coding since it isnʻt as strict.  Coding is very particular in accuracy and perfection so I wouldnʻt want to pick up any lazy habits along the way no matter how big or small. Althought, these three languages that I have knowledge about seem similiar in ways such as structure or loops/if statements.   
Here is an example of the 3 different languages being compared(Java, Javascript, C):

```js
public void isEmpty() {
    if (top == null) {
        return true;
    } else {
      return false;
}

System.out.println(stack.isEmpty());
```
```js
function isEmpty() {
    if (top === null) {
        return true;
    } else {
      return false;
}
console.log(stack.isEmpty());
```
```js
int main() 
{
    print f("Name: \t Aubrie Usui\n Hello");
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Practice Makes Perfect

For athletic software engineering, my professor gives us a WOD, which is a "workout of the day".  These are similar to pop quizzes, but you have to create the algorithm within a certain time range.  I think these are super useful for me since I tend to take my time with coding.  I need to learn how to create algorithms on the fly without thinking because it will be useful in my career.  You never know when a sudden problem or situation will pop up and you should be ready without panicking.  This WOD trains my brain to think immediately about the problem solutions instead of first panicking then thinking. This was one of weaknesses so I look foward to developing this skill in this course to also apply it to other courses in the present and future.  

Overall, I think Javascript is a good language to learn, but also not as helpful as other languages.  I think that from a software engineering perspective, it would be a bad programming language because it feels like a beginner language.  Although, my answer may change within the time frame of now until I graduate because I donʻt have a lot of knowledge of the entire program yet.  For right now, I think that it would make me become lazy with my coding and that isnʻt good for anyone that wants to go far with this major.
