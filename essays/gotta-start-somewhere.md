When I started this software engneering class, I didn't know what I would learn or what to expect.  I thought this class would just teach me the fundamentals and how software engineering works, but instead I had the opportunity to learn different types of platforms and use it to make products that I could put to use in real life.  My knowledge widened with not only learning another piece of computer science, but also with useful tools that make me feel confident going into a job with these skills.  The whole point of going to college and taking degree courses is to prepare the person for real world jobs and allowing the student to find their passion in that field of study.  I think if a student can walk away from a class and feel confident in being able to use their learnings for a real paid job, then the professor did their job well.  This class made me feel comfortable with pursuing a career in software engineering and all the questions I had were answered.
