## Overview 

*The problem:* There are people who want to start working out or stay fit, but lack the motivation to do so.  During this corona virus quarantine, we are limited for workouts.  It is very easy to fall into the couch and not move for decades.  As a result, we lose motivation to do anything and treat our bodies correctly.  

*The solution:* Fit Limited creates a fun way for all homebody people who lack the resources and/or motivation to get active by: 

* Sending daily affirmations to keep you motivated and mentally positive
* Creating workout specifically for you
* Creating workouts with specific equipment
* Creating workouts targetting desired muscles
* Providing instructions for drills
* Insprirational/triumph quotes at the end of your workout
* Allowing you to workout in a group with friends (even with geographical distance)

## Mockup Page Ideas 

Some possible mockup pages include: 

* Landing Page
* User Home Page
* Admin Home Page
* User Profile Page
* Admin Profile Page
* Workout Home Page
* Browse workouts by muscle, equipment, time, type, etc.

## Use Case Ideas

Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, goes to home page, sets up profile.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, goes to home page, edits site.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, finds workouts with user's interests, starts workout, finishing quote.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, connects with friends, finds workouts with same interests, starts workout with group facetime, finishing quote. 

## Beyond the Basics 

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

* Allow others to input their own workout suggestions
* Allow reviews of workouts and feedback
* Push notifications to user to motivate them to workout (Text message interface?)
* Show online friends
* Provide previous workouts history list
* Facetime with friends during a synced workout
