I grew up with the mindset of finishing everything that I start.  No matter how hard the task, I needed to get it done and I have done that every time.  This past semester, I took a pre-requisite class called “Algorithms”.  I was warned that this class would be hard, but never in my imagination did I think it would be so overwhelming.  

## About This Class

The class name is pretty self-explanatory.  All we did was learn about different algorithms, its purpose, its advantages/disadvantages, how to create algorithms, etc.  You would think this is easy by reading it, but it actually was very draining.  We had 2 quizzes every week, a problem set due every week, 2 homework readings and notes from the textbook due twice a week.  When it came to exams, we didn’t have any guide as to what would be on the test.  I typically don’t do well in test-taking to begin with, so you can imagine my anxiety level having to do this class.  To add on to that, we aren’t even able to see our previous tests because they wanted to reuse questions for the cumulative final exam.  At this point, I felt like they weren’t trying to help us pass.  Paired with other classes that also take up a lot of outside classroom time, it didn’t really help me at all as well.  

## The Struggle Is Real

I struggled this semester.  I got frustrated more times this semester than any other semester. Honestly, there were a couple times I had to mute my professor because I was just so mad (don’t worry, it wasn’t anything super important).  Usually, when I finish a class at the end of the semester, I feel happy and accomplished.  Instead, I felt drained and overwhelmed.  I think I slept for two days after my last exam was done.  

## When Is It Too Much?

With all this reflection I have about this past semester, I begin to wonder when it really is too much.  Is it too much when the student feels like she can’t ask for an extension because she knows it’ll only make her fall behind even more?  Is it too much when the student only goes to class to get the participation points?  Is it too much when the student just feels mentally drained and doesn’t want to go any further?  I want to know when it is considered too much.  I know this is a hard major and I accepted that challenge.  I don’t have bad anxiety or get very flustered often, which is why my reaction to this class says something.  I feel like some of the stuff we learned, we won’t even use later in our careers.  I got a good grade in this class, but only because I got a lot of extra credit points on my homework assignments.  

## My Final Thought

I strongly stand by my belief that classes should allow students to learn in an interactive environment and challenge them, but also not be a danger to mental health.  The professors should care more about what their students are retaining and less on the grade.
